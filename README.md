# Stock Info Interface
#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>
#### Description:
This Interface gives the user the latest stock price of a stock depending on how long ago the user requests the data, ranging from 1 day ago to 5 years ago.
Includes feature such as multi-stock input, chart-like output, which makes it easy to read.
Also includes advanced metrics such as P/E Ratio and Dividend Yield and automatically includes the historical data over the past 5 days.
#### Setup:
Git clone the repo<br>
cd into the folder you cloned<br>
run the main.py file using 'python main.py'<br>
#### Goals:
I aim to give this project a web interface, but probably won't happen for a while.
